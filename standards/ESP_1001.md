# Proofhash Standard

## Abstract

## Specification

Metadata for all Erasure Contracts MUST be shaped as a JSON object with the following fields:

```
{
  metadata_version: string),
  application: string,
  app_version: string,
  app_storage: [bytes],
  ipld_cid: multihash,
}
```

This JSON MUST be stringified and converted to hex representation to pass to the metadata bytes field.

## Motivation

## Backwards Compatibility
